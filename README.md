# Knight Trevails
A solution to The Odin Project's challenge of the same name. The goal is to find the shortest path between points on a chessboard for a knight to traverse. The program takes in start and end coordinates and returns the coordinates of each square the knight will visit on its path. 

The user can also use an optional argument, `useChessNotation`, to specify if the coordinates in the output of the program should be named like squares in a chessboard(A4, D3, etc).
